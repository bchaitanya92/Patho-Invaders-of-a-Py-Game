Patho-Invaders is a simple 2d vertical shooting game made using python and pygame. The game can  be run both on pc or android using pydroid3.

Patho-Invaders is a simple learning game for kids to know how our Immune System works in our body. This game also helps them to understand how to deal with smaller to bigger disease. 

It's my 1st py-game for the end-users.

Install pydroid3 on Android from here : [pydroid3 playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=en_IN&gl=US)
